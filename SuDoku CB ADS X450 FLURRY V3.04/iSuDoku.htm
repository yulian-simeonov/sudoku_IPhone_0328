How Hard Can It Be?</p>
<p>SuDoku is a number placement puzzle based on an 18th century invention by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler.  It has grown in popularity in Japanese puzzle books over the last 20 years and since the puzzles began to appear in western newspapers in late 2004 it has taken the World by storm! <br />
  So what does it involve? <br />
  SuDoku means &lsquo;single number&rsquo;.  Simply fill the grid with the numbers 1 to 9 so that each column, row and 3x3 box contains each number once and only once.  Although numbers are typically used you don&rsquo;t require any mathematical skills, just logic.<br />
  Sounds easy doesn't it?<br />
  But remember ... the simplest puzzles are often the hardest and most addictive ...<br />
  <br />
  When you first start Mastersoft SuDoku a default 'Simple' SuDoku will be created. The numbers that initially appear are fixed and coloured black. It is now up to you to complete the missing numbers (or pictures). There is ONLY one answer!</p>
<p>A newly created SuDoku:<br />

  <br />
  <strong><a name="levels" id="levels"></a>Levels</strong><br />
  <br />
  There are six levels of difficulty to choose from. If you are new to SuDoku we strongly recommend starting with the 'Simple' ones. There are over Ten Million SuDokus built in. In fact there are more SuDokus built into Mastersoft SuDoku than would be possible to complete in a lifetime! <br />
  If we take into account Mastersoft's unique Picture SuDoku then of course we now have 12 levels and over Twenty Million SuDokus! You will never run out! <br />
  Just be sure to take plenty of breaks.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong><a name="builtinsudokus" id="builtinsudokus"></a>The Built In SuDokus</strong><br />
  <br />
  The SuDoku generator built into Mastersoft SuDoku creates 100% genuine SuDokus*, each with one solution only. When creating a SuDoku, Mastersoft SuDoku solves it first in the background in the same way that a human would. This ensures that SuDokus created are appropriate to the level selected. This 'smart' way of creating SuDokus is (currently) unique to Mastersoft SuDoku!</p>
<p>* Note that Master Levels feature extreme SuDokus that may require guesses. In addition they are not always symmetrical. However they always have only one unique solution. For the majority of us mere mortals then, Very Hard is difficult enough ... You also have the option of turning off symmetry for levels one to five.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong><a name="creatinganewsudoku" id="creatinganewsudoku"></a>Creating A New SuDoku</strong><br />
  <br />
  When you create a new puzzle the Timer is started automatically.<br />
  To create a new SuDoku select the option from the main Menu. There are six different levels to choose from. <br />
  The 'Simple' level is best to get you started.<br />
  Note that Mastersoft SuDoku could take up to 30 seconds to create a new SuDoku. That is because it not only has to create an extremely difficult SuDoku, but it also has to solve it in order to be able to offer hints should you need them. However on average a new SuDoku is created in just a few seconds.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong><a name="enteringyourownsudoku" id="enteringyourownsudoku"></a>Entering your own SuDoku</strong><br />
  <br />
  Simply select the menu item. You can now enter a valid SuDoku. Be sure to enter it correctly then click OK.<br />
  <br />
  When you enter your own SuDoku the app will first check that it is a real one, and then solve it but not show the results. This allows Mastersoft SuDoku to offer hints even though it did not create the SuDoku - far better than getting stuck using pencil and paper! If you accidentally enter a SuDoku which cannot be solved then Mastersoft SuDoku will give up after 30 seconds.<br />
  Alternatively you can solve the entered SuDoku immediately by selecting the option from the menu.<br />
  Please do not use Mastersoft SuDoku to win newspaper prizes. That is not our intention.<br />

  <strong><a name="thestandardkeypad" id="thestandardkeypad"></a>The 
Default Keypad</span></strong></p>
<p class="style1">Use 
  the keypad to enter numbers or candidates (your working out) onto the puzzle.</span></p>
<p class="style1"><strong>&nbsp;1. 
  Standard number entry:</span></strong></p>
<p class="style1"><img src="iNumberMode.gif" alt="two" width="306" height="78" /></p>
<p class="style1">When 
  the right icon on the Keypad shows alarge pencil you can enter standard 
  numbers. These are the numbers that you consider are correct. You can 
  select different colors for different numbers, a feature that many 
  advanced players find useful.<br />
  When in Standard mode the keypad will disappear as soon as you select 
  a number key and the cell will then contain the selected 
  value. <br />
  If you wish to clear the cell then click the 'X' button.</span></p>
<p class="style1"><strong>&nbsp;2. 
  Candidate mode:</span></strong></p>
<p class="style1"><img src="iCandidateMode.gif" alt="one" width="306" height="78" /></p>
<p class="style1">Click 
  the pencil icon and it changes to a grid with a small 
  pencil icon. Additionally the size of the numbers on the keypad will 
  change to indicate whether you are in Standard mode or Candidate mode. </span>You can now 
  enter any or all of the numbers 1 to 9 into the one cell. Use this feature 
  to enter the numbers that you consider to be possibilities when you 
  are not certain of the correct number.</span></p>
<p class="style1">When 
  in Candidate mode the keypad will remain even though you have selected 
  a number. This is because multiple selections are possible. 
  Clicking the 'X' button in Candidate mode will clear all your candidate 
  entries for the particular cell. </span></p>
<p class="style1">Simply 
  click on another cell to confirm your entries and continue entering 
  more candidate numbers or click the tick button to confirm 
your entries and close the keypad.</p>
<p><strong><a name="optionalfloating" id="optionalfloating"></a>The 
  Optional Floating Keypad</span></strong></p>
<p class="style1">An optional floating keypad is available. This offers you an alternative way to enter your answers. </p>
<p class="style1"><img src="HStandardModeOn.gif" width="80" height="80" /></p>
<p><strong>Floating Keypad Options</strong></p>
<p>Various options exist for you to tailor the behaviour of the floating keypad. There are settings so that you can drag it, keep it open, get it to stay in one place etc.</p>
<p>Keypad is Dragable<br />
When this option is turned on then you can use your finger to drag the floating keypad around the screen.</p>
<p>Keypad is Sticky<br />
  When set to &quot;Sticky&quot; the keypad will remain wherever you dragged it to rather than be placed over the box you clicked on.</p>
<p>Autohide Keypad<br />
  Determines whether the keypad disappears after a number is selected.</p>
<p class="style1"><br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong><a name="ballofstring" id="ballofstring"></a>Ball of String / Flag Trail</strong><br />
  <br />
  The Ball of String and Flag Trail are new features unique to Mastersoft SuDoku.<br />
  If you imagine your SuDoku game is a maze then the Ball of String can be taken through the maze alowing you to return easily at any time. <br />
  At any point in the game you can click the Flag Trail icon to select a colored flag. This will then be placed at the current point along your string's path.<br />
  <br />
  <img src="bos.gif" width="314" height="46" /><br />
</p>
<p> <br />
  In the example above we have clicked the Ball of String icon. We can now drag the marker to any past point on our piece of string, however we will most likely want to drag it to one of the Flagged points that we considered important.</p>
<p>As with a ball of string, once you go backwards then you're on your own if you want to go forwards again.</p>
<p>To make your selection permanent just click the tick. To cancel just click the cross. </p>
<p>Note that to conserve resources Ball of String information is not saved if you exit Mastersoft SuDoku.<br />

  <strong><a name="wizardsandhints" id="wizardsandhints"></a>Wizards and Hints</strong><br />
  <br />
  Sudoku now has two types of hint in two separate menus. The wizard <img src="t5.gif" width="42" height="30" /> will give you clues but not an answer i.e. deduction is still required. The advanced hint <img src="t6.gif" width="42" height="30" /> actually gives you some sort of answer e.g. selecting the Show Naked Singles will tell you which cells contain singles and thus the answer to one or more cells.<br />
  There are many different types of wizard and hint available starting with basic type hints and moving on to advanced ones. If you are new to SuDoku then you will most likely find the wizards and hints at the top of the menus are the easiest to understand. Experienced players will appreciate the advanced hints such as Naked Quads and Jellyfish. Using a hint will reduce the score available for the game in play. Basic hints reduce the score by between 10 and 90% whereas advanced hints reduce it to zero. Games that have been played using one or more hints are excluded from the gameplay statistics and will reduce the score to zero. You can however use as many hints as you like. Games played using Wizards are still counted towards statistics. However using lots of Wizards will result in games that have low scores with long times being recorded to complete them.<br />
  The amount by which a particular wizard will reduce your score if used is shown in brackets e.g. 10% <br />
  <br />
  Results of a Hint <br />
  The results of all hints are based upon the original SuDoku plus the entries that you yourself have made eg if you add the number 2 to a box then clicking on another cell in that box with the 'Possible Values for a Cell' hint will show that a 2 cannot go there. <br />
  <br />
  Wizard types explained:<br />
  <br />
  Possible Values for a Cell:<br />
  Select this wizard then click on any cell to see which values can be placed in that cell. This wizard remains active until you click the hint icon a second time. <br />
  Possible Cells for a Value:<br />
  Select this wizard to see where you can place a certain number or picture. <br />
  Impossible Cells for Value:<br />
  Select this wizard to see where you cannot place a certain number or picture. <br />
  Highlight Duplicate Row/Col/Box:<br />
  This hint will highlight a row, column or box containing duplicate numbers/pictures. <br />
  Highlight Duplicate Value:<br />
  This wizard highlights any duplicate numbers / pictures. <br />
  Show All Candidates:<br />
  Shows the candidates of every cell that does not yet have a entry in it (except candidate entries). <br />
  Calculate All Candidates:<br />
  Same as above except that the values are stored as if you had worked them out yourself. <br />
  Auto Candidates:<br />
  Selecting this wizard will turn on the auto candidates feature. This causes Mastersoft SuDoku to re-calculate all the candidates each time you enter or clear a value. Auto Candidates cannot be used in conjunction with One click candidates as setting them to automatic entails not entering them yourself. <br />
  Suggest a Technique:<br />
  Mastersoft SuDoku will suggest a way in which to approach the current SuDoku puzzle. <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Hint types explained:<br />
  <br />
  Wrong Values:<br />
  While a value may be possible it is not necessarily correct. This hint will highlight any wrong values/pictures that you have entered. <br />
  Suggest a Cell:<br />
  Suggests a suitable cell to work on. This hint looks for a cell with as few possibilities as possible. <br />
  Suggest a Value:<br />
  Suggests a number or picture i.e. this hint basically gives you the answer to a cell's value. This hint looks for a cell with as few possibilities as possible before displaying a value/picture. <br />
  Highlight Singles:<br />
  Highlights any cells with just one candidate. <br />
  Highlight Hidden Singles:<br />
  Highlights any cells where there is more than one candidate but one of the candidates only appears once in the row/column/box i.e. it must be the value for that box. <br />
  Highlight Twins:<br />
  Highlights any cells with just two candidates where the two candidates are the same. <br />
  Highlight Hidden Twins:<br />
  Highlights any two cells that contain a hidden pair of twins. <br />
  Highlight Triplets:<br />
  Highlights any 3 cells with just three candidates shared between them. Note that if any triplets are found involving singles then they will be not be included in the results. <br />
  Highlight Hidden Triplets:<br />
  Highlights any three cells containing a hidden triplet. Note that if any hidden triplets are found involving singles then they will be not be included in the results. <br />
  Highlight Quadruplets:<br />
  Highlights any 4 cells with just four candidates shared between them. Note that if any quadruplets are found involving singles then they will be not be included in the results. <br />
  Highlight Hidden Quadruplets:<br />
  Highlights any four cells containing a hidden quadruplet. Note that if any hidden quadruplets are found involving singles then they will be not be included in the results. <br />
  Highlight X-Wings:<br />
  Highlights any four cells forming a column or row based X-Wing. There may be many X-Wings or else none atall. Row based X-Wings (if any) will flash blue. Column based X-Wings (if any) will flash orange. Box based X-Wings are beyond the scope of Mastersoft SuDoku as they are difficult for humans to spot. <br />
  Highlight Swordfish:<br />
  Highlights any six cells forming a column or row based Swordfish. There may be many Swordfish or else none atall. Row based Swordfish (if any) will flash blue. Column based Swordfish (if any) will flash orange. Box based Swordfish are beyond the scope of Mastersoft SuDoku as they are difficult for humans to spot. <br />
  Highlight Jellyfish:<br />
  Highlights any eight cells forming a column or row based Jellyfish. There may be many Jellyfish or else none atall. Row based Jellyfish (if any) will flash blue. Column based Jellyfish (if any) will flash orange. Box based Jellyfish are beyond the scope of Mastersoft SuDoku as they are very difficult for humans to spot. Note that Jellyfish are extremely rare, even in the Master levels.</p>
<p> <br />
  <br />
  <strong><a name="scoreandrating" id="scoreandrating"></a>Score and Rating</strong><br />
  <br />
  Score:<br />
  <br />
  To see your score click the <img src="ying.gif" width="30" height="30" /> symbol. Your total score will be displayed along with the total number of SuDokus that you have successfully completed. Note that your score and rating are not affected by any SuDokus that are not created by Mastersoft SuDoku i.e. when you enter your own. When you complete an inbuilt SuDoku your score is increased according to SuDoku difficulty and time taken to complete.<br />
  <br />
  Note that the score available for a SuDoku in play is displayed next to this symbol. When this reaches zero there are no points available on completion. However you are free to continue completing the SuDoku.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Rating:<br />
  <br />
  To see your rating click the <img src="shield.gif" width="30" height="30" />  icon. Note that there are many different shields, the one shown being the lowest. The best way to improve your rating is to attempt SuDoku Master Levels ... however these are extremely difficult and you are advised to master the earlier levels first.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong><a name="statistics" id="statistics"></a>Statistics and Advanced Statistics:</strong><br />
  <br />
  You can click the  symbol to get basic statistics of how many games you have played (without using hints), however advanced statistics are also available. To access the advanced statistics click the Menu item followed by the Advanced Statistics item. You are now presented with a list of each of the levels (and a reset option in case you ever wish to reset all the statistics). Select the level whose statistics you wish to view e.g. selecting &quot;Simple&quot; will display the maximum score, minimum score, average score etc for all the Simple Level SuDokus that you have completed. <br />
  <br />
  The reason that games where you have used a hint are not included in the statistics is that their statistics would be rather meaningless. You could achieve record scores and times simply by using various hints in succession.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong><a name="timer" id="timer"></a>Timer</strong><br />
  <br />
  When you play a SuDoku the timer is used to time how long it takes you to complete it. The score awarded upon completion will be based upon this time. Click the Timer symbol to pause or resume play.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong><a name="picturesudoku" id="picturesudoku"></a>Picture SuDoku </strong><br />
  <br />
  One of the many unique features of Mastersoft SuDoku is new Picture SuDoku! This is where it gets really hard!<br />
  <br />
  Picture SuDoku is no different to playing with numbers, except that colour coded pictures are used.</p>
<p><img src="egpicsudoku.gif" width="159" height="159" /><br />
  <br />
  We recommend trying Picture SuDoku only when you have mastered at least the medium level SuDokus.<br />
  <br />
  To select a Picture SuDoku simply choose Picture Styles from the Options menu (Menu-&gt;Options-&gt;Style). <br />
  <br />
  When playing Picture SuDoku candidate entries are represented by small coloured blocks.<br />
  <br />
  Colours are roughly equivalent to those of the rainbow, red, orange, yellow, green and so on.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong><a name="options" id="options"></a>Options</strong><br />
  <br />
  There are a number of options to enhance your SuDoku experience such as turning individual sounds on or off, selecting puzzle symmetry, and different number and picture formats. To view the options simply select the OPTIONS item from the main menu. <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong><a name="skins" id="skins"></a>Skins</strong><br />
  <br />
  Mastersoft SuDoku for iPhone uses Skins so that you can change the appearance of SuDoku. </p>
<p>To change how SuDoku looks select the Options menu then either 'Number Styles', 'Picture Styles', 'Background Styles' or 'Skin Presets'. Skin presets are simply pairs that the author feels complement each other eg Plain Numbers with a Plain Grid. </p>
